#  Introduction

In order to promote the research and application of semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms, we have developed LAMDA-SSL which is a comprehensive and easy-to-use toolkit for SSL in python. LAMDA-SSL has powerful functions, simple interfaces, and extensive documentation. It integrates statistical SSL algorithms and deep SSL algorithms into the same framework. At present, LAMDA-SSL contains 30 semi-supervised learning algorithms, including 12 algorithms based on statistical machine learning models and 18 algorithms based on deep learning models. LAMDA-SSL also contains 45 data processing methods used for 4 types of data: tabular, image, text, graph and 15 model evaluation criterias used for 3 types of task: classification, regression, and clustering. It is compatible with the popular machine learning toolkit scikit-learn and the popular deep learning toolkit Pytorch. It supports Pipeline mechanism and parameter search functions like scikit-learn and also supports GPU acceleration and distributed training functions like Pytorch. LAMDA-SSL includes multiple modules, such as data management, data transformation, model application, and model deployment, which facilitates the implementation of end-to-end SSL.

# Quick Start

For example, train a FixMatch classifier for CIFAR10.

Firstly, import and initialize CIFAR10.

```python
from LAMDA_SSL.Dataset.Vision.CIFAR10 import CIFAR10

dataset = CIFAR10(root='..\Download\CIFAR10',
                  labeled_size=4000,download=True)
labeled_X, labeled_y = dataset.labeled_X, dataset.labeled_y
unlabeled_X = dataset.unlabeled_X
test_X, test_y = dataset.test_X, dataset.test_y
```

Then import and initialize FixMatch.

```python
from LAMDA_SSL.Algorithm.Classification.FixMatch import FixMatch
model=FixMatch(threshold=0.95,lambda_u=1.0,mu=7,T=0.5,epoch=1,num_it_epoch=2**20,device='cuda:0')
```

Next, call the fit() method to complete the training process of the model.
```python
model.fit(X=labeled_X,y=labeled_y,unlabeled_X=unlabeled_X)
```

Finally, call the predict() method to predict the labels of new samples.
```python
pred_y=model.predict(X=test_X)
```

# Performance

We have evaluated the performance of LAMDA-SSL for semi-supervised classification task on table data using BreastCancer dataset. In this experiment, 30% of the instances are randomly sampled to form the testing dataset by the class distribution. Then 10% of the remaining instances are randomly sampled to form the labeled training dataset and the others are used to form the unlabeled training dataset by dropping their labels. For detailed parameter settings of each method, please refer to the 'Config' module of LAMDA-SSL.
